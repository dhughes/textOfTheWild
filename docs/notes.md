# Other thoughts

If I go through the Hyrule compendium I think it tells me where the various items can be found and other useful details

Interfaces:
	edible - things that can be eaten (apple, mighty carp, etc). these restore hearts
	cookable - things that can be cooked (apple, monster parts, fairy, ancient core, etc). these can be used to make meals or elixirs
	mobile - things that can move / escape. frogs, fish, insects

Types of things:



	mobs
		animals
		monsters
		horse - a special kind of animal. can be tamed / stored in stables

		mobs drop items

Types of items:

	foods / monster parts / flowers / animals / cooking ingredients

	dishes / elixirs

	items / minerals
		amber
		Ancient Core (might be an ingredient - can be used to make elixirs )
		Ancient Gear
		Ancient Screw
		Ancient Shaft
		Ancient Spring


* things in the world:
	* houses / buildings
	* doors (can be opened)
	* camp fires
		* burnt out camp fires too
	* cook fire / hot plate thing
	* meltable blocks of ice (large and small)
	* trees:
		* white trees with no leaves (in snowy area)

 	* temperature
	* wind
	* rain / snow / storm

	* when you first encounter something in the world, you don't know what it is
		* "???"

# questions:

* can you burn down trees?
*


# world:

Scene # any scene (ground, cliff, water, building, etc)
	exits = [] # an array of places you can exit the current scene
	altitude = 0 to 255 # a numeric value indicating relative height of the scenery
	descriptions = {
		in: "A cliff juts out into... rocks crunch under your feed..." # descriptive text for where you are
		near: "" # what you can see when looking at this scene through an exit. May be blocked by altitude changes or trees

	}

When different scenes connect at different-enough heights you have to climb a cliff / rock wall to go up. The different in altitude indicates how much stamina it will take to climb. You can climb down as well.

You can jump down a cliff/rock wall and, optionally, use your paraglider to land gently.




Room < Scene
	windows = [] # an array of windows you can look out.
	direction = n/s/e/w, etc # the direction the window faces.
	broken? = true/false # you can climb out broken windows.

lowest color: 3c2e01
highest color: c4c8b1

world position: 8300,4090
	* Description:
		* You are in a grassy field that gently slopes downhill to the south east
		* V-shaped cliff juts out to the north
		* There's a group of trees to the south. Behind them is an imposing rock wall.
		* An opening in the rocks leads into a dark cave (the time tomb)
	* Entities:
		* Trees
		* Mushrooms?
	* Bordering areas:
		* NW, N, NE, E: Down cliff area
		* SE, S: Down gentle slope area
		* SW, W: Cl
	* Exit points:
		* Enter time tomb
		* Jump off northern cliff (Maybe you get a chance to open your paraglider before you hit the ground?)
		* Climb down northern cliff (Requires a degree of stamina. If you run out you fall however far down the cliff)
		* Climb up southern cliff (Requires sufficient stamina or you fall and maybe get hurt)


Maybe areas in the world know how to describe themselves from various distances and perspectives.
	We'd need to think about relative altitudes and distances away.
		* relative altitudes:
			* same
			* lower
			* higher
			* steeply lower (see further)
			* steeply higher (see less)
			* far distance (when I have a higher altitude)
		* I can't see past things at my height or higher.

	0 spaces (where you are right now): Very detailed
	1 space away at same altitude: Moderate detail
	2 spaces away at same altitude or down: nothing
	2 spaces away at higher altitude:




	Maybe climbing happens a bit at a time? EG, if the cliff is super high you have to go through a set number of climb up/down/(left/right?) phases until you reach the top/bottom? Each phase uses up stamina.


	* North: Cliff that drops sharply down
	* North East:
	* South: Small grassy field
	*
	* East
	* The grass below your feet is soft and green. You are at the top of a high cliff that drops steeply downward. The drop off extends in a wide arch first extending before you, but then bending back to the south
