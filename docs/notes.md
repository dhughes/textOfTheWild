# Other thoughts

If I go through the Hyrule compendium I think it tells me where the various items can be found and other useful details

Interfaces:
	edible - things that can be eaten (apple, mighty carp, etc). these restore hearts
	cookable - things that can be cooked (apple, monster parts, fairy, ancient core, etc). these can be used to make meals or elixirs
	mobile - things that can move / escape. frogs, fish, insects

Types of things:



	mobs
		animals
		monsters
		horse - a special kind of animal. can be tamed / stored in stables

		mobs drop items

Types of items:

	foods / monster parts / flowers / animals / cooking ingredients

	dishes / elixirs

	items / minerals
		amber
		Ancient Core (might be an ingredient - can be used to make elixirs )
		Ancient Gear
